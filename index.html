                    <p class="quote-text">The challenge of ending displacement is inseparable from the challenge of establishing and mainting peace. When wars end, farmers return to their fields; children return to school; violence against women declines; trade and economic activity resume; medical and other services become more accessible, and the international focus changes from relief to development and self-sufficiency. All this makes new wars less likely. It is a virtuous cycle that deserves nurture and support.</p>

                            <li>Rampant foreclosures, evictions, and inflated housing cost that have dispossessed Oakland's low-income residents for over the last decade are tied to carceral modalities that explicitly target the city's Black and Latinx demographic.</li>
                            <li>"Policing the borderlands" section I,  explore how Oakland's 2010 gang injunctions spatially confined Black and Latinx youth to their neighborhoods, what local activists have recognized as carceral policies that extract value from the neighborhood and further the displacement of residents of color.</li>
                            <li>Quanittive research can document gentrification by measuring changing property values and demographics, but qualitative work is essential to analyze the ways that these trends inform lived experiences and communities' understandings of their circumstances.</li>
                            <li>Oakland has recently become one of the country's leaders in urban farming. Oakland is now home to numerous grow-ops turning vacant lots into farmland. One group, City Slicker Farms (spaces open to the public), over 180 Backyard Gardens, a weekly Farm Stand, a greenhouse, and [numerous] Urband Farming Education programs.</li>
                            <li>Moving rates in Downtown Oakland and parts of North Oakland remained consistently in the top two quintiles, and rates of moving out of Oakland increased in these areas from the recovery to the post-recovery period when the housing market recovered from the Great Recession.</li>
                            <li>Parts of East Oakland and Downtown Oakland are experiencing rising financial instability, while Deep East Oakland and pockets of West Oakland with long histories of disinvestment continue to experience disinvestment.</li>
                            <li>In 2010, Oakland had a population of 390,724 with white residents making up 25.9% of the city and African-American residents making up 28%. Nine years later, the racial demographics of the city had changed drastically. With a population of 433,031, 35.5% of Oakland residents were white, and 23.8% African-American.</li>
                            <li>Among those facing the consequences of gentrification are children in public schools. "There's been more funding to the public schools following Prop 39. The problem, though, is that 45% of the funding goes to the 30% of the students that are in charter schools in Oakland."</li>
                            <li>Gentrifying neighborhoods have resulted in a substantial displacmeent of African-AMerican households in Oakland, including loss of Black home owenership.</li>
                            <li>African-Americans in Oakland decreasing by nearly half between 1990-2011, and how home ownership dropped from 50% to 25% and the decline of this population by 17 percentage points--from 43% to 26%--"the largest drop of any population group."

                        <p class="importance-text-response">
                            Gentrification in Oakland, California is important to me because this is a topic in a low-income area, people of color, minorities all over are facing but unaware of what it is and what is happening. The people of color, low-income residents, and minorities are unaware of the difference between gentrification and Revitalization. These same people are experiencing social isolation which causes a person to feel uncomfortable, like they do not belong, and change. I feel like this topic is important to me because this is where low-income residents, minorities, and people of color can gain knowledge, create resources, and become aware to bring awareness from people in their city to people across the United States. When I watched Priced out and watching what people who are the same color as I am did not understand the gentrification and who did understand the gentrification was affecting by the change and there was nothing, they could do opened my eyes. This topic is important to me because this shows how African Americans are being forced to adapt to changes, they have little to no knowledge of. The people who create this change is maximizing the cost by raising rent which creates profit. This topic is important to me because people who hold power are likely to repeat the same cycle if it has a profit.
