            <p>The challenge of ending displacement is inseparable from the challenge of establishing and mainting peace. WHen wars end, farmers return to their fields; children return to school; violence against women declines; trade and economic activity resume; medical and other services become more accessible, and the international focus changes from relief to development and self-sufficiency. All this makes new wars less likely. It is a virtuous cycle that deserves nurture and support.</p>
